# Developer onboarding

This page is a first-week tutorial. It assumes you already know a little JavaScript (variables, functions, `import`/`export`) and can use a terminal, but not that you have shipped an Express app before.

Read it in order. After each “Try it” section, stop and do the steps before reading on.

## What you are looking at

This repository is a **boilerplate**: a starter app you copy and customize. It is an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server (Node.js HTTP framework) that can:

- Render HTML pages with [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templates
- Sign people in with a local username/password, [Formbar](https://github.com/csmith1188/Formbar.js), and/or Microsoft Entra
- Expose a small JSON API at `/api/v1`
- Optionally talk to Redis, email, Seq, background jobs, and Formbar’s HTTP/WebSocket APIs

**Optional features stay off until you turn them on.** A flag in `.env` is not a hint. If `EMAIL_ENABLED=false`, the app must not connect to SMTP, register email routes, or send mail. That rule is the most important design choice in this codebase.

---

## Words you will see constantly

| Term | Meaning here |
| --- | --- |
| **HTTP request** | A browser or client asking the server for a URL (`GET /auth/login`, `POST /auth/login`). |
| **Route** | The URL + method mapping. Lives in `src/routes/`. Routes should not contain business rules. |
| **Middleware** | A function that runs *before* (or around) the route: sessions, CSRF, “are you logged in?”, rate limits. |
| **Controller** | Reads the request, calls a service, writes the response (HTML redirect or JSON). Lives in `src/controllers/`. |
| **Service** | The use case: “register this user”, “link Formbar”. Services must not use `req` or `res`. |
| **Repository** | SQL only, through Knex. No HTTP, no Formbar, no “if the user is an admin”. |
| **Integration** | Talks to something outside this app (Formbar, Entra, Redis, SMTP). |
| **Container** | `src/container.js` — the one place that *constructs* services. Disabled flags mean those objects are never created. |
| **Session** | Server-side login state, stored in a cookie (`fbapp.sid`). Not a JWT the browser sends on every API call. |
| **CSRF** | Cross-site request forgery protection. HTML forms include a hidden `_csrf` field so other sites cannot POST as you. |
| **RBAC** | Role-based access control. Roles (`user`, `admin`) grant permissions (`account.self`). The client cannot “send” a role to become admin. |
| **Feature flag** | An explicit `true`/`false` in `.env`. Do not infer “email is on because SMTP_HOST is set”. |

If a new feature needs a Formbar call, that call belongs in `src/integrations/formbar/`, used by a **service**, used by a **controller**. Do not `fetch` Formbar from a route file.

---

## What you need installed

1. **Node.js 22 or newer** (`node -v`). The `engines` field in `package.json` requires this.
2. A terminal (PowerShell is fine on Windows).
3. A browser.

You do **not** need PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, or Visual Studio C++ tools for the first run. Development SQLite uses [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/) (WebAssembly), so there is no native `better-sqlite3` build.

---

## First boot (local auth only)

Do this before you enable Formbar or Redis. If `.env.example` has `FORMBAR_AUTH_ENABLED=true` and you have not filled in client credentials, **startup will fail** with `Invalid configuration`. That is intentional.

### 1. Copy environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell: `Copy-Item .env.example .env`

Open `.env`. For the first session set:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true
FORMBAR_AUTH_ENABLED=false
ENTRA_AUTH_ENABLED=false
EMAIL_ENABLED=false
SOCKET_IO_ENABLED=true
REDIS_ENABLED=false
API_ENABLED=true
API_DOCS_ENABLED=true
BACKGROUND_JOBS_ENABLED=false
DATABASE_PROVIDER=sqlite
DATABASE_URL=./data/app.sqlite
WEB_CONCURRENCY=1
LOCAL_AUTH_EMAIL_FLOW=disabled
```

Leave `SESSION_SECRET` and `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as long dummy values in development. Replace them before any shared or production host. Never commit `.env`.

`LOCAL_AUTH_EMAIL_FLOW=disabled` means you can register and sign in **without** verifying email. Production with local auth **requires** email (`EMAIL_ENABLED` + SMTP). See [authentication](authentication.md).

### 2. Install and create the database

```bash
npm install
npm run db:init
```

`db:init` runs migrations (creates tables) and seeds (inserts `user` and `admin` roles plus permissions). The SQLite file appears under `data/`.

### 3. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

`--watch` restarts when you save files. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the home page and a way to sign in.

If the process exits immediately, read the terminal. Zod prints **all** config problems at once (missing `FORMBAR_CLIENT_ID`, SQLite with `WEB_CONCURRENCY=2`, and so on). See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

### 4. Prove the process is healthy

In another terminal or the browser:

- [http://localhost:3000/health/live](http://localhost:3000/health/live) — process is up
- [http://localhost:3000/health/ready](http://localhost:3000/health/ready) — database (and Redis, if required) is reachable

These paths are **not** under `/api`. Load balancers and Docker healthchecks use them.

## How a request moves through the app

Example: you submit the login form.

1. **`src/server.js`** already loaded `.env`, validated it, created a logger, and started HTTP.
2. **`src/app.js`** (middleware stack) attaches a request id, Helmet/CSP, cookies, session, CSRF, rate limits, then “current user” if a session exists.
3. **`src/routes/auth.js`** matches `POST /auth/login`.
4. **`src/controllers/auth-controller.js`** reads the body, calls local auth, regenerates the session, redirects.
5. **`src/services/local-auth-service.js`** checks username/password (Argon2id hashes), lockout, email-verify rules.
6. **Repositories** in `src/repositories/index.js` run Knex SQL against `users` / `local_credentials`.
7. Failures become typed errors (`ValidationError`, `AuthenticationError`) and **`src/middleware/error.js`** renders an HTML page or JSON. Production responses never include stack traces.

**Try it:** set a breakpoint or add a `console.log` in the controller *and* the service. Submit a bad password. Confirm the service throws and the controller/error handler turns that into the login page message — the service never called `res.render`.

The same layers apply to JSON: `GET /api/v1/me` is registered only if `API_ENABLED=true`. Unauthenticated browser navigations to that URL redirect to login; clients that ask for JSON get `401`.

Wiring lives in **`src/container.js`**. If `FORMBAR_AUTH_ENABLED=false`, `formbarOAuth` is `null` and Formbar routes are not registered. You cannot “accidentally” call Formbar from a disabled module if you follow this pattern.

## Folders that matter on day one

```
src/server.js          start here
src/config/            .env → typed config + flags
src/container.js       construct only enabled pieces
src/routes/            URLs
src/controllers/       HTTP
src/services/          rules
src/repositories/      SQL
src/integrations/      Formbar, Entra, email, Redis
src/middleware/        session, CSRF, auth, errors
src/database/          Knex + migrations + sql.js
views/                 EJS HTML
public/                CSS/JS the browser loads
tests/                 Vitest
```

[folder-structure.md](folder-structure.md) is the short map. You do not need `deploy/` until you ship to Ubuntu.

## First-time features: what to turn on, and in what order

Treat this as a ladder. Do not enable Redis, Entra, jobs, and Formbar WebSockets on day one.

### Layer A — always on for local exploration

| Flag / setting | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true` | You can register a user without Formbar credentials. |
| `DATABASE_PROVIDER=sqlite` | No Postgres install. |
| `WEB_CONCURRENCY=1` | SQLite cannot run with multiple workers. |
| `SOCKET_IO_ENABLED=true` | Realtime exists; with one worker it does not need Redis. |
| `API_ENABLED=true` | `/api/v1/me` |
| `API_DOCS_ENABLED=true` | Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs` |

### Layer B — after local login works

| Flag | What you are testing |
| --- | --- |
| `FORMBAR_AUTH_ENABLED=true` | “Continue with Formbar” on `/auth/login`. Requires `FORMBAR_BASE_URL`, `FORMBAR_CLIENT_ID`, `FORMBAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `FORMBAR_REDIRECT_URI`. For [formbar.yorktechapps.com](https://formbar.yorktechapps.com) use `FORMBAR_OAUTH_MODE=legacy_redirect`. See [formbar.md](formbar.md). |
| `FORMBAR_HTTP_EXAMPLE_ENABLED=true` | Example HTTP call (development only; forced off in production). Needs Formbar base URL. |

Leave `FORMBAR_WS_CLIENT_ENABLED` off until you have a reason to open a **server-to-server** Socket.IO connection to Formbar. Browsers must not use Formbar’s API key.

### Layer C — only when you need them

| Flag | Requires | Skip until |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS_ENABLED` | Redis running | You run more than one Node process, share sessions across workers, or enable jobs. |
| `BACKGROUND_JOBS_ENABLED` | Redis in production | You have a real queued job. |
| `EMAIL_ENABLED` | SMTP host/from | You want verify/reset mail, or you deploy production local auth. |
| `ENTRA_AUTH_ENABLED` | Tenant, client id/secret, redirect URIs | School Microsoft login is required. |
| `SEQ_ENABLED` | Seq URL | You want structured logs in Seq. |
| `LOAD_TEST_FEATURES_ENABLED` | Never in production | Forced off in production. Load tests are a **CLI** (`npm run loadtest`), not an HTTP route. |

**Production** (`NODE_ENV=production`) forces example/debug/load-test HTTP off and requires email when local auth is on. SQLite + clustering is rejected. You cannot “sneak” those on with extra env vars.

## Hands-on checklist (first afternoon)

Work top to bottom. Check each box in your notes.

### Local account

1. Open `/auth/register`. Create a username, email, and a long password.
2. Sign in at `/auth/login`. You should land on `/` (or `next=`).
3. Open `/account`. You should see a **local** identity. You cannot unlink it (it is your only sign-in method).
4. Sign out. Confirm `/account` sends you back to login.

### Session and CSRF (security you can feel)

1. Stay signed in. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies. You should see `fbapp.sid` (HttpOnly: the page’s JavaScript cannot read it).
2. View source on a form. There is a hidden `_csrf` field. Submitting without it should fail (403 / CSRF page).
3. Wait, or lower `SESSION_IDLE_MS` in `.env` in a throwaway experiment, restart, and confirm idle expiry. Put the original value back.

### Health and API

1. `/health/live` and `/health/ready` return success while the app is up.
2. Signed in, open `/api/v1/me`. You should see your user JSON (roles/permissions included).
3. Open `/api/v1/docs` if docs are enabled. This is generated from comments in `src/routes/api.v1.js`, not a second source of truth for behavior.
4. Sign out, then request `/api/v1/me` with `Accept: application/json` (or from the docs “try it”). Expect **401**, not an HTML login page.

### Automated tests

```bash
npm test
```

Suites:

- `tests/unit` — functions in isolation (config, OAuth URL builders)
- `tests/integration` — database adapter, etc.
- `tests/e2e` — HTTP through the real app (register/login)
- `tests/security` — CSRF, linking rules

External systems are mocked. Tests use SQLite. Also run `npm run lint`.

If Vitest hangs on OneDrive/Windows, retry; it is an environment quirk, not your feature flags.

### Optional: Formbar (Layer B)

1. Set `FORMBAR_AUTH_ENABLED=true` and the Formbar variables. Restart. Config must boot cleanly.
2. Sign in with **Continue with Formbar**. You should hit Formbar’s `/oauth` login page, not a JSON error about `/api/v1/oauth/authorize`.
3. After redirect, `/account` should list a **formbar** identity. If you also have local auth, you can link/unlink as long as one method remains.
4. Do not paste access tokens into URLs in *your* new code. Legacy Formbar production still returns `?token=` to *this* app’s callback; this app verifies the JWT against Formbar `/certs`.

---

## How to add a feature without making a mess

1. Decide if it is optional. If yes, add a flag in `.env.example` and `src/config/env.js`, then construct it only in `container.js`.
2. Add a **service** method. Put SQL in a repository. Put Formbar HTTP in the Formbar client.
3. Add a **route** that only binds middleware + controller.
4. Add or extend an EJS view or `/api/v1` handler.
5. Add a test that would fail if the flag is ignored (disabled feature must not register the route).
6. Read [authentication](authentication.md) before you invent a second session or put roles in the browser.

**Do not:**

- Call Knex from a controller
- Read `process.env` in random files (use `loadConfig()` / the container’s `config`)
- Enable Redis “because Socket.IO is on” (one worker does not need it)
- Auto-migrate every production worker (`DATABASE_MIGRATE_ON_START` is not for clustered PM2)

## When something breaks

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| Process exits listing config keys | `.env` incomplete; Formbar flag on without client id/secret |
| `/health/ready` is 503 | SQLite file missing (run `db:init`) or Redis required but down |
| CSRF 403 | Form posted from another origin, or missing `_csrf` |
| SQLite + cluster error | `WEB_CONCURRENCY` > 1 |
| Formbar JSON “endpoint does not exist” | Browser was sent to `/api/v1/oauth/authorize`; use `legacy_redirect` |
