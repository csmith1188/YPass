# AGENTS.md - YPass

Index for agents. Read this first, then open only the files listed for your task.

## What this is

YPass is a production-grade Node.js 22+ ESM hall-pass application built with Express 5 and EJS. It provides local, Formbar, and optional Microsoft Entra authentication; SQLite/PostgreSQL persistence; server-side sessions; Socket.IO realtime support; manager workflows; appointments; and a separately deployed kiosk machine client.

The application is layered deliberately:

- Routes bind URLs and middleware.
- Controllers translate HTTP requests into service calls and responses.
- Services own use cases and business rules.
- Repositories own Knex queries only.
- Integrations talk to Formbar, Entra, Redis, or SMTP.
- `src/container.js` constructs enabled dependencies.
- `kioskMachine/` is a thin local kiosk UI and proxy. The central server remains authoritative for kiosk identity, pass decisions, and state transitions.

Disabled features must not register routes, sockets, jobs, or external connections.

## Run

| Command                    | Purpose                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`              | Start the watch-mode server       |
| `npm start`                | Start the production-style server |
| `npm test`                 | Run all Vitest suites             |
| `npm run test:unit`        | Run unit tests                    |
| `npm run test:integration` | Run integration tests             |
| `npm run test:e2e`         | Run HTTP end-to-end tests         |
| `npm run test:security`    | Run security-focused tests        |
| `npm run lint`             | Run ESLint                        |
| `npm run format:check`     | Check Prettier formatting         |
| `npm run audit`            | Audit production dependencies     |
| `npm run loadtest`         | Run the localhost-only load CLI   |

Local setup: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, disable integrations you do not have credentials for, run `npm install`, then `npm run db:init`. For the simplest local run use local auth, SQLite, one worker, and disabled Formbar/Entra/email. Do not commit `.env`, secrets, `kiosk-config.json`, logs, or runtime database files under `data/`.

## Request and startup flow

A normal HTTP request follows:

1. `src/server.js` loads and validates environment configuration.
2. `src/bootstrap.js` creates the container, checks dependencies, creates the app/server, and starts optional realtime/jobs.
3. `src/app.js` applies request IDs, logging, security headers, compression, parsing, cookies, sessions, CSRF, rate limits, and current-user loading.
4. `src/routes/` selects middleware and a controller.
5. The controller calls a service; services call repositories or integrations.
6. Typed errors reach `src/middleware/error.js`, which chooses HTML or JSON output.

Keep business rules out of route files and keep `req`/`res` out of services and repositories. Use the container's typed `config`; do not read `process.env` throughout the application.

## Security invariants

- Sessions are server-side; do not introduce a second browser auth mechanism or put roles in client-controlled data.
- Mutating browser forms/API requests require CSRF protection as configured by `src/middleware/csrf.js`.
- Authorization is server-side. Client-supplied user IDs, roles, permissions, or manager status are not trusted.
- Passwords use the existing Argon2id implementation. Tokens and sensitive values must follow existing redaction/audit patterns.
- Feature flags are explicit. Do not infer that an integration is enabled because an environment variable happens to exist.
- Production guards in `src/config/features.js` are intentional. SQLite cannot be used with multiple workers; clustered Socket.IO/background jobs require Redis.
- Never log secrets, access tokens, passwords, session IDs, or raw credential payloads.

## Database and environment rules

- SQLite uses the sql.js adapter for local development and tests; PostgreSQL uses `pg` in production.
- Schema changes belong in migrations, not startup code. Use `npm run db:migrate` as a one-shot migration step for production; do not auto-migrate every worker.
- Seeds establish roles and permissions and should remain safe to run through the existing seed command.
- `.env` is local secret/config state. Use `.env.example` and `wiki/system/` as the documented configuration surface.

## Tests and verification

Use the narrowest relevant suite first, then widen as needed:

- Config/feature changes: `npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/config.test.js`
- Auth/RBAC/password changes: `npm run test:unit` plus relevant `tests/security/`
- Database changes: `npm run test:integration`
- HTTP/controller/view changes: `npm run test:e2e`
- Realtime changes: `npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/formbar-ws.test.js` and affected e2e/integration coverage
- Broad changes: `npm test && npm run lint`

Tests use Vitest and temporary SQLite databases through `tests/helpers/`. External systems should be mocked. For browser-facing or networking changes, smoke `/health/live` and `/health/ready` and run the affected server mode when practical.

## After you add a feature or change behavior

1. Update the owning source of truth (`config`, service, repository, integration, or migration).
2. Thread the change through the nearest controller/route or client/view surface.
3. Preserve feature-flag dependency and production guard rules.
4. Add or update the narrowest relevant Vitest coverage.
5. Update `docs/openapi/v1.yaml`, `wiki/`, or `.env.example` when the public contract or setup changes.
6. Run focused tests, then `npm run lint` and broader tests when the change warrants it.
7. Update this index if you add a major module, command, route family, or ownership boundary.

## Hall-pass and kiosk ownership

- `src/services/pass-service.js` is the authoritative pass state machine. It enforces student identity, one active pass, destination-aware scans, round-trip transitions, appointment auto-approval, and server-clock expiry.
- `src/repositories/index.js` owns hall-pass, appointment, location, kiosk, event, and heartbeat queries. The partial unique index `passes_one_active_per_student` is the database concurrency guard.
- Migrations `002_pass_system.js` through `006_returning_pass_state.js` define students, locations, kiosks, passes, events, appointments, kiosk credential hashes, heartbeats, appointment usage, and the returning-state concurrency guard.
- `/api/v1/kiosks/enroll` accepts a short-lived manager-generated enrollment code and returns the kiosk code plus one secret. Enrollment codes expire after 10 minutes and can be used once.
- `/api/v1/kiosks/options`, `/heartbeat`, `/scan`, and `/request-pass` are authenticated with `x-kiosk-code` and `x-kiosk-secret`. Only the hash is persisted centrally; the secret is returned once during enrollment.
- The manager panel at `/manager` creates enrollment codes and regenerates credentials. Credential regeneration disables the kiosk until the new code is used.
- `kioskMachine/` stores the issued secret in local `kiosk-config.json` with restrictive file permissions. It must never send that secret to browser JavaScript or expose it in logs.
- The kiosk UI may collect student details and destination selections, but it must display central responses and must not implement pass approval, completion, expiration, or state transitions.

Focused hall-pass verification: `npx vitest run tests/unit/pass-staff.test.js tests/e2e/kiosk.test.js tests/e2e/kiosk-enrollment.test.js` and `npm --prefix kioskMachine test`.
